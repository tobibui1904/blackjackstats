Okay!! Since you don't know the rule, let Tobi help you. Don't worry, it's pretty easy and fun

After the initial two cards, the player has up to four options: "hit", "stand", "double down", or "surrender". 

Hit: Take another card.

Stand: Take no more cards; also known as "stand pat", "sit", "stick", or "stay".

Double down: Increase the initial bet by 100% and take exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed next to the original bet. Some games permit the player to increase the bet by amounts smaller than 100%. Non-controlling players may or may not double their wager, but they still only take one card.

Surrender: Forfeit half the bet and end the hand immediately. This option is only available at some tables in some casinos, and the option is only available as the first decision. Fortunately, Tobi's blackjack allows you, my deer players, to do that.

That's all. Good luck!!!!!

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER.
